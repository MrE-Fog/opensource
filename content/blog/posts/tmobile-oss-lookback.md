It was one year ago today (on my birthday) that T-Mobile [publicly embraced the
open source
community](https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/t-mobile-embraces-open-source/)
with the release of
[Jazz](https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/introducing-jazz/) — a
framework to unlock the full potential of serverless computing. It was both the
start of a new journey for T-Mobile and a significant milestone along a path
that we have been on for the past two and a half years: [from telco to
technology company](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/t-mobile-combines-product-technology-delivery-customer-cody-sanford/).

So, I think now is a great time to reflect on the progress we made over the last
year…

* T-Mobile’s [Jazz development](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz) is now done in an
“open source first” model, meaning the majority of our work is immediately
available in Open Source Software (OSS). Adoption is increasing, and we have
multiple internal and external parties both using and contributing to the
project. Work is now also under way to support using Jazz with multiple cloud
providers and on-prem.
* We released
[T-Vault](https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/introducing-tvault/), a
simplified secrets management solution as our first project in an “open source
only” model. This means there is no internal T-Mobile technology stack.
Development only happens in the open and any company-specific integrations are
accomplished via configuration.
* [NEXT (formerly Hyper
Directory)](https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/hyperdirectory-blockchain-innovation/),
our blockchain-based identity and access platform, has been donated to the [The
Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project](https://www.hyperledger.org/) and is
under [active
development](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory) by us and
others, including Intel and Microsoft. As our second “open source only” project,
we are moving towards doing 100% of the planning and design in the open.
* We’ve also released
[Casquatch](https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/casquatch-intro/), a Java
abstraction layer for Cassandra, and several projects to support [chaos
engineering](https://opensource.t-mobile.com/blog/posts/chaos-engineering/).
* And today, I’m super excited to share that we’ve released [PacBot](/blog/posts/introducing-pacbot/), a system that delivers continuous compliance with a concept called
“policy as code”. Internally, PacBot has been a significant security and
operational bar-raiser and cost-saver.

To us, being a leading tech company means we must be a world-class software
development and product management organization. And in the last year, it has
become increasingly clear that open source development **is** world-class
software development. By necessity, the community has figured out how to take a
globally dispersed group of people with varying needs and motivations and turn
them into an agile team that can deliver quality software and user experiences
(traditionally a challenge in the enterprise).

We’re excited to continue pushing ahead on this journey, including leveraging an
“internal open source” model to bring teams closer together on projects that we
are not able or ready to make public. Looking back, I am filled with a great
sense of pride for my colleagues —especially the developers — who contribute to
this ground-up effort. 

And so this year on my birthday, T-Mobile has given me the same exact gift it
did last year, but I wouldn’t want it any other way: a meaningful initiative
that is having a real impact in our digital transformation journey, passionate
people to work on it with, and a sense of purpose that fills me with excitement
when I walk into work every morning.
