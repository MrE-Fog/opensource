As the [Un-carrier](https://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news-and-blogs/categories/un-carrier/), T-Mobile is transforming wireless. Technology and software development play a key role in enabling that transformation.

We work every day on technology to make systems more robust while enabling faster delivery at reduced cost--all so we can provide more value to our customers!

Today we are making available as open source, both large and small projects that contribute to that effort:

* [Jazz](https://github.com/tmobile/jazz-core) is being developed by T-Mobile's Cloud Center of Excellence to make it easier to dev, deploy and operate solutions, shifting workloads from VMs and IaaS to serverless and container platforms.
* [ABF](https://github.com/tmobile/abf_authorization) is a lightweight library and data format that simplifies handling entitlements.
* Finally, we are making available the code and CI/CD automation we use to publish our own [open source site](https://github.com/tmobile/opensource).

As users of open source, we've seen first-hand the value the community brings in accelerating innovation. Now with these first projects, we look to start on another journey of transformation: from technology consumers to producers.

We are excited to engage the tech community, share ideas and solve problems big and small together. And it's no secret that, with this initiative, we hope to [recruit talented developers](https://tmobile.careers/) who are as passionate about building great software as we are.
