The Un-carrier revolution is all about people. It’s about our customers. We’re customer obsessed…and we stop at nothing to have their back. That means making sure our passionate, dedicated employees who live the Un-carrier values day-in and day-out, are empowered to deliver our customers their best work.       

I’m excited to share how that customer obsession is manifesting within our Magenta walls. Before, we had a separate product team working with a separate Digital Technology & Development team. While we had common objectives, we were siloed. This slowed down collaboration and innovation. As the Un-carrier, slowing down is unacceptable.

So, today, I’m proud to introduce you to my new and empowered team – Product & Technology!

## One Team, One Dream

 Obviously, we’ve been focused on building new technologies that bring innovative products and experiences to life for our customers and front-line employees for a long time now. But we saw a real opportunity to be even better and re-align our approach as a world-class product management organization. It sounds simple, really. We streamlined our operations and clarified our focus. This straightforward evolution of our people and teams enables us to act like a modern technology company – one that empowers its employees to make decisions and to innovate the customer experience. We share one common vision: disrupting the wireless industry and kicking our competitors’ asses. Bringing Product & Technology together under one roof is an organizational structure that doesn’t exist in most companies like ours. What’s really exciting is that T-Mobile is now at a place where we can take advantage of it!

 The vision for Product & Technology is to create defined interfaces, consolidated intake and workflow, and empowered teams to catapult us forward to be able to better translate business needs into products, and own those products from design through development, sustainment and long-term innovation… all to the benefit of our customers!

## The Next Step in Digital Transformation

This organizational shift to Product & Technology is a key driver of T-Mobile’s digital transformation journey and is a shining example of why a transformation of this size and scale needs to start with our employees. While “digital transformation” can feel like a buzz word and companies from all sectors can claim to be technology companies, we’re first and foremost in pursuit of the transformative behaviors and ways of working that come with being a tech company. We’re proud of being a best place to work – not just in wireless, but a best place to work, period. And I’m so excited to lead a world-class technology team that powers T-Mobile every minute of every day.

Just look at the new [T-Mobile Team of Experts](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/introducing-tex)! It’s a radical reinvention of customer care that Product & Technology worked hard on behind the scenes for the past two years. I am so proud of my team for the work they’ve done to make this simplified experience a reality for our customers.

As the Un-carrier, we’re unafraid of being ambitious – there’s no playbook for the future, we’re writing it. There are opportunities for everyone, and you’re empowered to take them. [Click here](https://tmobile.careers/meet-our-teams/technology) to find your place in the Un-carrier revolution.
